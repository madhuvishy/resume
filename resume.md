## Stuff I do

My work these days usually consists of **Javascript** and **Node** work,
primarily with frameworks like **React** or **Hapi**.
I also spend a fair amount of time with **Clojure**.

I'm a big fan of **BDD** and **TDD**. I lean towards libraries like **Mocha**
and **Cucumber**, but I have also used **Jest**. I've wrestled quite a bit
with **Selenium** too.

I prefer **SCSS** and I've worked or dabbled in **Python**,
**Java**, **PHP**, and **Erlang** as well.

I also tend to work in the command line, preferring **Linux**,
and tools like **Vim**, **Tmux**, and **Zsh**.

Sometimes I put on my DevOps hat with some experience in **Docker**,
**Mesos**, and **CI/CD**, but I'm no expert.

I'm not too bad at Googling, either.
